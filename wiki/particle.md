## Particle

A **particle** is a kind of [word](word.md) that performs a grammatical function.

### Morphology

Particles are recognizable by their [morphology](morphology.md) as they follow one of the following patterns:

- Starts with a single *non-sonorant consonant*, followed only by [*vhowels*](vhowels.md). (Examples: **zi**, **mio**, **tiho**)
- Starts with a *[sonorant](morphology.md#sonorants))* or *vowel a or o*, and is a string of [*vhowels*](vhowels.md) and *sonorants*. They can end either with a *vowel* or *sonorant*. (Exemples: **a**, **ol**, **ahu** or **nu**)

### Families

Particles are organized in **families** that have identical grammar but convey different meanings. Those families contains particle that all follows a specific pattern (example: all particles starting with f-), and are designated by the first allowed particle following this pattern (in [Eberban alphabetical order](alphabet.md)), written uppercase (example: **FI**). Multiple related families often start with the same letter.

- Vowel/sonorant initials: sentence particles
    - [A](A_family.md) (a-): Sentence which doesn't define a predicate, and is followed by a predicate chain.
    - [O](O_family.md) (o-): Sentence which defines a predicate, and is followed by a predicate chain.
